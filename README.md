# Hire Me – Vynn Suren  
*Philosopher • Researcher • Systems Thinker*  

I design and investigate complex systems — moral, legal, cultural, and technical — and translate them into usable frameworks, stories, and tools. My work draws from philosophy, logic, anthropology, and computational modeling to address real-world problems.  

> 💡 **Looking for:** Roles where I can apply deep conceptual analysis, build formal and computational models, and bridge theory with real-world impact — in research, governance, law-tech, or interdisciplinary problem-solving.
